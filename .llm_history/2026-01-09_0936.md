Summary of updates to implement new requirements from `AGENTS.md`:

- Configuration management implemented in `src/main.rs`:
  - Added global variables `POLL_INTERVAL` (default 60 seconds) and `PI_READ_WRITE` using `once_cell::sync::Lazy` with atomics for thread-safe access.
  - Implemented `ensure_config_exists()` and `ensure_config_exists_at(path)` to create `pimonitor.yaml` on startup with blank values for `pi_api_key` and `pi_api_secret` when missing. Existing files are not overwritten.
  - Implemented YAML parsing via `read_yaml_config()` and configuration evaluation via `evaluate_config()`:
    - Reads `pimonitor.yaml` and sets `POLL_INTERVAL` to the provided `poll_interval` if it is an integer strictly greater than 30; otherwise falls back to 60 seconds.
    - Sets `PI_READ_WRITE` to true only if both `pi_api_key` and `pi_api_secret` are present and non-empty; otherwise false.
  - The YAML config is read right before each polling interval starts; the ticker is recreated if the interval changes. The config file is ensured to exist at program startup.

- Tests:
  - Added unit tests inside `src/main.rs` to validate configuration logic and file creation behavior:
    - Default and threshold behavior for `poll_interval`.
    - Read/write eligibility based on presence of both keys.
    - Ensuring config file creation when missing and preserving existing content when present.

Notes:
- No functional changes were required beyond aligning the application flow with the documented requirements; the code now conforms to the new `AGENTS.md` directives.
