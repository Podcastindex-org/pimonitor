- Implemented AGENTS.md requirements:
  - Polling new/recent feeds now includes `since` (now − 86,400 seconds) and `max=500` query params.
  - Filter out feeds marked as dead: hides items where `dead` is `true`, `1`, or the string equivalents.
  - Added keybinding `d` to report selected feed as problematic using Podcast Index endpoint `/report/problematic?id=<feed_id>` with proper `X-Auth-Key`, `X-Auth-Date`, and `Authorization` (sha1 of key+secret+date) headers.
  - On successful problematic report, the app refreshes the feed list automatically; on failure, an error is displayed in the status area.
  - Configuration behavior:
    - Ensure `pimonitor.yaml` is created on startup if missing with blank `pi_api_key`/`pi_api_secret`.
    - Read configuration right before each polling tick; enforce `poll_interval` must be an integer > 30 seconds, otherwise default to 60.
    - Update global `POLL_INTERVAL` and `PI_READ_WRITE` (true only when both key and secret are present).

- Tests:
  - Added/verified tests under `tests/` for Podcast Index auth header building and credential loading.
  - Aligned expected Authorization digest with `sha1(key + secret + X-Auth-Date)`.
  - All tests pass locally.

- Misc:
  - Minor cleanups to remove warnings.
